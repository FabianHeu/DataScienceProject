Course: Applied Data Science with Python


Project description:
Based on the dataset “India's Vaccination (1 billion glory doses)” I want to show the vaccination process in India. The dataset has 44 columns and approx. 2 years of data. It starts from 2020-01-30 until 2021-11-13. I will compare this data to the data acquired in Germany. The vaccination data for Germany will be received from the Robert-Koch-Institut and the Department of Health.
