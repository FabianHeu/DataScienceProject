Project description:
Based on the Covid19 dataset from ‘Our World In Data’ (https://ourworldindata.org) I want to visualize the effects on all countries in the world. 

The dataset has 44 columns and approx. 2 years of data. It starts from 2020-01-30 until 2021-11-13. I will compare this data to the data acquired in Germany. The vaccination data for Germany will be received from the Robert-Koch-Institut and the Department of Health.

Goal: 
Compare the vaccination progress of the countries worldwide. Investigate and correlate the vaccination progress to new cases and deaths per million inhabitants. The results should be presented as a python dashboard.
